**This Java project simulates a basic hotel booking system.**

The program guides the user through selecting a city, choosing check-in and check-out dates, picking a hotel, and selecting a room type. It then calculates the total cost of the stay based on the chosen hotel and room category.

This project is a simple demonstration of object-oriented programming concepts and user input handling in Java.
